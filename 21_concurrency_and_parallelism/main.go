	simultaneously).

--> Concurrency in Go is a fundamental concept, and the language provides robust support for it
	through goroutines and channels. Goâ€™s concurrency model is lightweight and designed to enable
	programs to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.



--> Components <--

--> Goroutines:
	. Lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime.
	. Created using the go keyword.
	. Thousands of goroutines can run concurrently in a single program.

--> Channels:
	. Used for communication and synchronization between goroutines.
	. Provide a way to safely share data.

--> Select Statement:
	. Waits for multiple channel operations, enabling responsive and concurrent code.

--> sync Package:
	. Provides primitives like sync.Mutex for mutual exclusion.

/*

--> Why l1 and l2 are not getting executed
--> Because the main function is terminating before the goroutines have a chance to run.
	In Go, when the main function of your program exits, the entire program terminates,
	including any running or scheduled goroutines.

	. The time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) gives only 2 seconds for the previous goroutines to execute.
	. After the sleep, the main function ends without waiting for the new goroutines
	  (go printNumbers(1, 30) and go printNumbers(1, 40)) to complete.
	. Goroutines run concurrently, but their execution depends on the Go scheduler. If the main
	  function exits before the goroutines get a chance to execute, they won't run.

--> To solve it we have to sync them.
