--> A struct in Go defines a blueprint for creating complex data types. It groups together
    fields that may have different types, similar to how a class works in object-oriented
    languages, but with fewer features.

--> A struct itself is a data type.
--> An instance of a struct can be called a variable.
--> When methods are attached, the instance can behave like an object.
