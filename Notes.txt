--> Go Language: It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically
    typed, interpreted language.
----> It gets converted in machine code in one go that not like line by line.
--> Variable type gets checked before run time by the compiler, so type errors are picked
    up earlier.
--> It is a strongly typed language means variable type cannot be changed after they have been
    declared.
--> It can be used in building web apps, rest api and cloud services.
--> It has a built in testing feature in its standard library.
--> It is an object oriented language but there is no concept of classes and objects, instead 
    it uses custom types and interfaces.

--> To run a code "go run file_name.go"
